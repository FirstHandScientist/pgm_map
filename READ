## Causal Inference

<sup id="ebbae5f70288dc30ee111f6185f56769"><a href="#pearl2018theoretical" title="Pearl, Theoretical Impediments to Machine Learning With Seven Sparks from the Causal Revolution, {arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.04016}, v(), (2018).">pearl2018theoretical</a></sup> explains the theoretical limits of current
state-of-art machine learning that are mostly based on statistical methods.

## The Probabilistic Graphical Models

Chapter~15 introduce Bayesian Networks, undirected graphical models/Markov random field, factor graph, and message-passing algorithms including sum-product and max-product.<sup id="46925c57259dfc7c3b5f0d20747e4ba7"><a href="#theodoridis2015machine" title="Theodoridis, Machine learning: a Bayesian and optimization perspective, Academic Press (2015).">theodoridis2015machine</a></sup>. 

### TODO Check **normal factor graph**, a variant of the factor graphs has been recently introduced, where edges represent variables and vertices represent factors.

### TODO Max-product and Max-sum, could be used to detect input signal structures, such as location of objects in pictures.

### TODO Could the back-tracking be combined with two-direction message flowing, in order to get optima of input signal?

## Interpretable Methods and Explanations

A general framework for learning different kinds of explanations for black box algorithms is proposed and experimentedcite:fong2017interpretable.
Google's interpretability tool: [lucid@github](https://github.com/tensorflow/lucid).
